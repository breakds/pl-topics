* Concepts
** Context-free Language
Any set of strings that can be defined if we add recursion to regular
set.
* Representation of Regular Expression
** Notes
Regular expression by definition has 
+ Concatenation
+ Disjunction
+ Repetition (0 or many occurences)
Adding "+" we have the definition in regexp.lisp
* Convert DFA to Regular Expression
** Algorithm 
d'(i,j) = d(i,k)d(k,k)*d(k,j)
** Notes
The iteration ends in n iterations, where n is the number of states in
DFA. This is analogical to Bellmen Ford in dealing with loops, since n
iteration guarantees that the largest loop (whose length <= n) will be
detected.
** Notes
The algorithm relies on reduction of regular expressions
